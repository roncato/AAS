## Abstract

This work was developed to simulate Natural Population Control Mechanisms on an Artificial Society of nonhuman primates. 
For the scope of this work, the type of primates chosen was Rhesus Monkey (Macaca Mulatta) due to their similarly with human beings both anatomically and physiologically.
Nonetheless, the Artificial Society Framework allow extension in simulating other types of primates including humans. 

The agent modeling approach taken was bottom-up, where the mechanisms are modeled at the individual agent and the results and emergencies of the system are observed. 
This approach was first introduced and systematically developed by (Epstein & Axtell, 1996) in an artificial society called Sugarscape.
This work employs similar methodology with additions of Event Based Simulation techniques and a Psychological Model of Mind States.  

The Mind States and Transitions are implemented by a Memory Deterministic Finite Automata was designed and implemented for four types of Ape Entities (Infants and Yearling, Juveniles, Adult Male, and Adult Female).
The environment of the Society was also modeled to approach a natural Rhesus Monkey Environment. 
Different Seasons maybe used to disambiguate results from Environment Carrying Capacity and Social-Psychological Mechanisms for Natural Biosocial Population Regulation.
